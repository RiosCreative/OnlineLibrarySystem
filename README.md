# Universal Library System

## Description

The ULS was created a way to securely access written, audio, or visual content libraries of all sorts in an ever-expanding catalog. Physical materials may be requested for hold or pickup from a library branch and digital materials may be borrowed directly through the system. This system will assume use of international standards for book/magazine sourcing and use of the Library of Congress classification (LCC).
